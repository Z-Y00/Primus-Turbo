"""Pure-FlyDSL MXFP4 activation quant kernels (no ``import torch`` at module top).

Bit-exact replacement for the C++ ``quantize_mxfp4_dual`` for the scored
``preshuffle=False`` recipes. This module is data-quant only; it never fuses
quant into the GEMM.

Numerics reproduce ``csrc/kernels/quantization/quantization_mxfp4.cu`` exactly:
  * e8m0 scale via ``compute_tile_scale`` (all-int32 recipe),
  * native ``rocdl.cvt_scalef32_pk_fp4_f32`` pair-form cvt (dst_sel chaining),
  * RHT = fixed H16 = H4 (within a 4-block) then H4 (across the 4 blocks) done
    fully IN-REGISTER (each thread owns a whole 32-elem microblock = 2 H16
    groups), bit-identical to the C++ distributed ds_swizzle version.
