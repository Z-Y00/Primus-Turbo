"""FlyDSL fp8 per-tensor grouped GEMM with the SwiGLU activation fused in.

Two entries: the fc1 forward, which emits the pre-activation ``l1`` and the
activation together, and the fc2 dgrad, which consumes ``dact`` in registers so
it never reaches HBM. Both go through the shared NT/NN kernel factories in
``grouped_gemm_fp8_kernel``, which carry the fused epilogue behind their ``glu``
and ``dglu`` flags -- the fusion reuses those mainloops rather than forking them,
so what lives here is the entry layer and the swizzle race it needs.

    Where the Triton twin computes a 2I-wide tile and permutes it to bring gate
