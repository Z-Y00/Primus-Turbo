"""Online autotuner for the fp8 combine's comm/GEMM CU split.

The combine runs ``max(PUSH, GEMM) + tail`` behind a scoreboard, so ``num_combine_cu`` -- how many
of the grid's blocks run the cross-rank PUSH -- sets where that balance lands. The optimum moves
with the expert shape: DeepSeek-V3 (H=7168, I=2048) wants 32, while Qwen3-30B-A3B (H=2048, I=768)
wants 80 on the L1 dgrad and 96 on the L2 forward. Shipping one constant costs the smaller shape
~8% of its step time, which is what this module exists to stop.

Why not ``flydsl.autotune``
---------------------------
The bf16 combine tunes the same knob with the stock ``@autotune`` decorator, which ``do_bench``\\ es
each candidate: warmup plus ``rep`` **extra** launches of the kernel. That is safe for a pure GEMM
and is not safe here. This kernel is a collective: it pushes into the shared symmetric buffer and
advances ``_combine_parity`` / the combine and reduce epoch expectations on device. Replaying it
off the real call sequence moves that state without a matching dispatch, and the failure mode is
not an exception -- it is a peer whose reduce waits on an arrival count that no longer matches, or
an output assembled from another epoch's payload.

So this tunes **online** instead: every candidate is measured on a real call that the model was
going to make anyway. One launch per call, exactly as before, with a CUDA event pair around it.

Reading the elapsed time would normally mean a sync, so the pair is parked and drained on a later
call, by which point the events have long completed -- the measurement costs no stall.

Lockstep
--------
Every rank tunes the same key in the same order (the shapes are static and all MoE layers of a
model share one key), so the candidate sequence is identical everywhere without coordination.
Only the *winner* could differ, since each rank times its own launches. ``group`` makes that
choice unanimous with one small all-reduce, once per key. It is optional: the CU count only
partitions this rank's own push work -- a receiver's expectations come from the routing, not from
how many blocks the sender split its push across -- so a divergent pick is a performance wart
rather than a correctness bug.

CUDA graphs
-----------
Tuning needs real, timed, synchronized launches, so it cannot happen inside a capture: a captured
call takes the winner if eager calls have already locked one, and the fallback otherwise
(``locked_combine_cu``). Replay never re-enters this code, so a graph captured before lock-in keeps
the fallback -- the pre-autotune constant -- for its whole lifetime. That costs the speedup, never
correctness, and it warns once per shape. Locking takes ``len(_CANDIDATES) * _REPS + 1`` eager calls
of a shape (all MoE layers of a model share one), which a short ``make_graphed_callables`` warmup
may not reach; run more eager steps before capturing, or pin the split with
``PT_MEGA_FP8_L{1,2}_COMBINE_CU``.
