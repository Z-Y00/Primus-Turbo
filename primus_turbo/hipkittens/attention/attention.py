"""HipKittens flash attention for gfx950 (MI355X), forward and backward.

The kernels are compiled into ``primus_turbo.pytorch._C`` like every other turbo kernel and
reached through ``torch.ops.primus_turbo_cpp_extension.hk_attn_*``. Their sources carry the
``_gfx950`` suffix, so the build leaves them out entirely unless gfx950 is among the offload
archs; a build that does include them compiles one object for every arch in the list, and
each body is guarded on ``__gfx950__`` so the other passes emit an assert-and-return. Neither
the build nor the guard stops a wrong call being made, which is what this module is for. It
checks the envelope, pads the sequence axes to the tile sizes the kernels report, and owns
every workspace allocation.

WHAT THESE KERNELS ADMIT, all enforced by :func:`hipkittens_attn_supported`:

* gfx950 only, and bf16 only.
* SBHD ``[s, b, h, d]``, contiguous.
* head dim 64 or 128.
* bottom-right causal, optionally with a left window. Non-causal is not implemented.
* ``Sq <= Skv``. See the note on that check for why the other direction is refused.
* no learned sink, no varlen/THD packing, no dropout, no bias, no alibi.

Anything outside that must not reach the kernels: they read out of bounds or return
uninitialized memory rather than failing, so the checks here are load-bearing rather than
defensive.
