"""Smoke test for the migrated ODC rocSHMEM backends.

The single-node host-API backend (originally librs_host5.so) and the multi-node
GPU-direct backend (originally librs_host_gda.so) were migrated into Turbo. The
implementations live in the kernels library (csrc/kernels/odc_rocshmem/*.cu,
declared in primus_turbo/odc_rocshmem/api.h); thin pybind bindings in
csrc/pytorch/dist/odc_rocshmem_*.cpp re-expose them as the ``odc_rocshmem_host`` /
``odc_rocshmem_gda`` submodules of _C. Both are compiled behind
``#ifndef DISABLE_ROCSHMEM``: on a toolchain without rocSHMEM the submodules are
simply absent from _C, so every test here skips instead of failing.

These are pure binding-surface checks: we verify the submodules exist, expose the
expected ABI symbols, and that the init-free ``rs_uid_bytes()`` sanity call is
callable and returns the rocSHMEM unique-id size (128). We deliberately do NOT
call anything that needs ``rocshmem_init`` (rs_init_uid / rs_malloc / gather /
reduce-scatter) so the test runs in a plain single-process pytest with no launcher.
