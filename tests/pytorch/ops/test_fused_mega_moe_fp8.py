"""Accuracy tests for the MXFP8 mega MoE against the turbo DeepEP MoE.

The fp8 sibling of ``test_fused_mega_moe.py``, and deliberately the same shape: same reference, same
metrics, same tensors compared, so the two files diff cleanly and an fp8-only regression shows up as a
threshold gap rather than a difference in method. The reference helpers are imported from that module
rather than copied, so both suites provably measure against the identical bf16 reference.

This drives the STAGED pair, because that is what training drives: Primus' ``MegaMoEFP8Experts``
(megatron/core/extensions/mega_moe.py) calls ``fused_mega_moe_fp8_stage1`` then
``fused_mega_moe_fp8_stage2``, and never the single fused ``fused_mega_moe_fp8``.

What this covers that the other fp8 tests do not: an END-TO-END accuracy gate against an INDEPENDENT
implementation. ``tests/pytorch/modules/test_mega_moe_mxfp8.py`` checks one stage (L1) against a torch
dequant GEMM, checks staged-against-fused -- that is, the op against ITSELF -- and checks a training
loop for finiteness only. None of those would catch the whole op drifting together.

The single fused entry is NOT covered here, and not by oversight. It defers the dW1 pool requant
(``prepare_dw1_pool_operand_fp8``) until after the L2 combine, while stage1 does it immediately after
L1. The pool is ``symm.pool_fp8``, which peers write cross-rank, and the combine is a cross-rank PUSH,
so in the fused order a peer's combine lands in the pool before this rank has snapshotted it: over 16
runs its dW1 came out at 22.5 dB (correct) or 2.9-8.9 dB (corrupted) about a third of the time, with
~8200 of 139264 pool rows -- one peer's worth -- observed to change between L1 and the requant. A test
that fails a third of the time teaches people to ignore failures, so the fused path stays out until
the requant moves up. Training is unaffected: the staged order has no such window, and its dW1
measured 22.52 dB on six consecutive runs.

        The single-pass test above reuses the symmetric workspace once; a training step reuses it
        ``num_layers * micro_batches * 2`` times, and two cross-rank handoffs in the fp8 combine
        were only correct on a cold workspace:

          * ``combine_gate`` (the gate gradient a peer scatters into this rank's CACHED main heap)
            was pushed and read without the system-scope cache bits, so every layer but the last
            read the gate gradient the NEXT layer's backward had left in L2 -- dtw fell from 23 dB
            to 6 dB on layers 0..L-2 while the last layer, whose backward runs with nothing in
            between, stayed correct.
          * the ``comb`` payload was pushed and read the same way, so a handful of slots per call
            were reduced from the FORWARD's y still sitting in the buffer. dx is ~1e-6 and y is
            ~1e0, so a few stale slots inflated dx by ~1e6 -- iteration-1 grad norm 1300 instead
            of 1.4, clip_grad turning every update into a 1000x smaller learning rate.

        Both need the workspace to be warm, which is why they are invisible to a single pass, and
        both are silent: no NaN, no hang, forward and loss unchanged.

        What this test needs that the earlier one did not: DISTINCT data per pass. ``generate_inputs``
        seeds its own generator, so passes built without a ``seed`` are the same micro-batch twice,
        and a buffer left holding the previous pass's values is indistinguishable from a correct one.

        dx and dtw are checked, not just the weight gradients: dx is where the 1e6 inflation shows,
        and dtw is where the gate staleness does. topk 8 runs alongside 6 as the control -- the
        training sweep found only powers of two surviving, and the timing of the comb race follows
        the tile count, so the two values exercise different schedules of the same code.
