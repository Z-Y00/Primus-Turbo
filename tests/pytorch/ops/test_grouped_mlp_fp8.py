"""Fused FP8 grouped MLP, driven through its public op, tensorwise and MXFP8.

``grouped_mlp_fp8`` runs fc1 with the gated activation fused into its epilogue
and fc2 after it, which is only worth doing if it agrees with doing the pieces
separately. So the op is driven end to end -- output and all four gradients --
against an eager per-expert fp32 reference, for every gate it takes.

The input and the fc1 activation are both quantised and the backward adds its
own, which puts the SNR floor well below a single GEMM's; the threshold only has
to catch a wrong answer, not the quantisation. Which backend answers is the
device's choice, not the caller's.

The two granularities differ only in the config they are handed, MX_BLOCKWISE
being NT-only and gfx950-only.
